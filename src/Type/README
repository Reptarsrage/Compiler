we maintain a graph which holds as fields (1) the primitive type nodes and
(2) a package node. We then do our first pass and fill that package node in with
the basic class information before diving in and doing our second pass where we
fill in each class in the graph with its methods, create the method nodes, etc.
Simultaneously, we build the symbol table stack to allow for identifier type
checking later on.
